# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an aspiring developer with a degree in mathematics. I recently completed a data science and machine learning bootcamp with Coding Dojo. I started my career in teaching and tutoring but I have since found quite a passion in Full-Stack development; especially Python and C#. I also enjoy working with C++ and Arduino as a hobby for my side projects. Lately I've been learning more about JavaScript and Rust.
