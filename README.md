# Welcome to my GitHub!

My name is Jamison Hunter! I'm aspiring to become a data scientist and developer after having graduated university in 2021. I have a degree in mathematics and a minor in physics, which has given me a lot of experience in problem solving; a valuablue skill for any data scientist or programmer! I am currently taking data science and machine learning with CodingDojo. This education along with my previous has been preparing me to enter this field. 

You can find my resume as one of my linked sites under my Linkedin. Thanks for stopping by!
