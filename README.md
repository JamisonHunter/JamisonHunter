# Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm an aspiring developer with a degree in mathematics. I recently completed a data science and machine learning bootcamp with Coding Dojo. I started my career in teaching and tutoring but I have since found quite a passion in working with Python backends as well as MongoDB. I have also encountered Arduino, which has become a major hobby of mine in the realm of programming! Recently, I've been tackling JavaScript with the Three.js library.
